# 🚧 FENCE — FENCE Ensures Nothing Crosses Edges

FENCE is a command-line tool that helps you ensure that your code changes do not exceed a specified line limit when compared to a base branch. It is particularly useful for maintaining code quality and preventing large, unwieldy pull requests.

### Important: Default branch  
If no base branch is specified, `fence` assumes `main` by default.

### Remote mode (`-r | --remote`)  
When `-r` is provided, `fence` compares your current local branch against its remote counterpart (e.g., `origin/main` or `origin/feature-branch`).  

- Without `-r`: compares changes against the specified or default **local** branch.  
- With `-r`: compares changes against the remote tracking branch.  

You can set the remote name with `-n` or `--remote-name` (default is `origin`):

```bash
fence -r -n upstream
```

Or set it via the environment variable:

```bash
export FENCE_REMOTE_NAME=upstream
```

### Examples

```bash
fence                          # Compares with `main` branch within the default limit: 250
fence develop                  # Compares with `develop` branch within the default limit
fence develop -l 100           # Sets custom limit
fence -r                       # Compares against origin/main
fence develop -r              # Compares against origin/develop
fence -b                       # Opens GitHub issue to report a bug
fence -g                       # Opens GitHub issue to suggest an idea
fence -i node_modules dist/    # Ignores specific paths during diff
```

> FENCE also ignores common lockfiles by default (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`).

### Customizing Messages

```bash
fence \
  -s "✅ All good: {total} lines changed, within {limit}" \
  -f "❌ Too many changes: {total} lines, max allowed is {limit}"
```

### Reporting Issues

FENCE makes it easy to contribute feedback:

- Run `fence -b` to open a **bug report** template with system info prefilled.
- Run `fence -g` to open a **suggestion** template to propose improvements.

## ⚙️ Persisting Configuration

Set environment variables to define defaults:

```bash
export FENCE_SUCCESS="✅ Inside limit! {total} lines, limit is {limit}"
export FENCE_FAIL="❌ Over the limit! {total} lines, limit is {limit}"
export FENCE_LIMIT=300
export FENCE_DEFAULT_BRANCH="develop"
export FENCE_REMOTE_NAME="upstream"
```

To persist these across terminal sessions, add them to your shell config (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
echo 'export FENCE_LIMIT=300' >> ~/.zshrc
```

## 🧩 GitHub Action

You can use FENCE to block large PRs in GitHub Actions.

### ✅ Basic usage

`.github/workflows/fence.yml`:

```yaml
name: FENCE

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  check-size:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run FENCE
        uses: nascjoao/fence@v0
```

### ⚙️ Customizing the action

```yaml
      - name: Run FENCE with custom messages
        uses: nascjoao/fence@v0
        with:
          base_branch: develop
          limit: 100
          success_msg: "✅ Within limit: {total} modified lines."
          fail_msg: "❌ Too many changes! Limit is {limit}, but found {total}."
```

## 🔄 Uninstalling
